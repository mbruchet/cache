# Introduction 
Caching can significantly improve the performance and scalability of an app by reducing the work required to generate content. Caching works best with data that changes infrequently. Caching makes a copy of data that can be returned much faster than from the original source. You should write and test your app to never depend on cached data
StartPoint Platform supports several differents caches. Basicaly the platform is provided with three providers : 
- <b>Redis</b> (DistributedRedisCacheRegister)
- <b>SQL Server</b> (DistributedSqlServerCacheRegister)
